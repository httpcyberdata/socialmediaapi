### Coding styles I used:

### What I learned
1. How to use modules in expressJS
Benefits:
 Use 'import' instead of const or var.

	First define the package scope by the type flag in package.json as "module"
	Second, add the --es-module-specifier-resolution=node flag in first order of the npm start command to run the module style code with node.
